# @vcmap/ui-demo
> Part of the [VC Map Project](https://github.com/virtualcitySYSTEMS/map-ui)

This demo project showcases multiple ways in which to use the `@vcmap/ui` module.
It presents two major application structures:

1. Embedded map ui with different layouts & custom map implementation
2. An application with two standalone applications running side by side.

Furthermore, it outlines how to build a project using `vite`, so you can use the provided library
assets.

## Usage
You must clone the repository & install its dependencies. Once setup, you can 
host the application using `npm start`. You can build the project using `npm run build` and
preview the built application with `npm run preview`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virtualcitySYSTEMS/map-ui-demo.git
cd map-ui-demo
npm i
npm start
```
